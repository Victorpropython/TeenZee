FOR TEEN WHO ARE FACING CHALLENGE AND NEED HOPE

### NOTE 2-13-2021

I developed IdeaDog with a partner for our final project at Holberton School. This master branch features what my partner and I deployed for presentation at Holberton. What it doesn't feature is a revamp I worked on independently afterwards, in an effort to practice Next.js, Express and Redux. You can view this revamped work at [this branch](https://github.com/bdbaraban/ideadog/tree/nextjs/frontend).

Please note that this app is no longer deployed.

## Description :bulb:

IdeaDog is a social media web application for sharing ideas.

We have all had those moments, those sudden bursts of inspiration where we think - "wow, that is simply a _great_ idea" - but know we will never follow up. Now, instead of losing those ideas, share them with the world!

### Why statically-typed?

Our kind of question.

The front-end of IdeaDog is built in React, with TypeScript, while the back-end runs on Rust. In our book, TypeScript + Rust = The Ultimate Statically-Typed Web App!

## Medium Blog Posts :newspaper:

For a more in-depth description of IdeaDog as well as an overview of its tech stack and development process, we have written a series of articles on Medium. You can read them at the links below:

Passwords are no fun. IdeaDog features a passwordless user authentication process managed by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). The process works as follows:

1. User enters email (for login) or both email + username (for signup). Front-end initially sends email/username to back-end.

   1. If logging in, and an account does not exist with the given email, back-end returns a redirect code, and user is directed to sign-up.
   2. Otherwise, back-end generates and returns a challenge token associated with the email.

2. Front-end temporarily stores challenge token in `localStorage`, then uses the Auth0 API to send a login email to the user. The login email includes a random code that user must enter to verify account.

3. Upon entering the verfication code, the user is redirected to the home page of IdeaDog. The redirect occurs on a URL hashed by Auth0 which the front-end parses to retrieve the user's Auth0 profile.

4. Front-end pulls up challenge token from `localStorage` and returns it to the back-end with the verified email. Back-end generates and returns a bearer token in the form of a cookie.

   1. After being returned to the back-end, the challenge token is cleared from `localStorage`.

5. The bearer token has been set and the user can fully acccess their profile!
